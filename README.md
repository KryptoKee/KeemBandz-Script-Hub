# KeemBandz-Script-Hub

Starting making my own Roblox Scripts and GUIs... Follow my journey and access all the open source scripts here. Enjoy!

First game i made a script for is ony of my favorite games, Street Outlaws Cash Days! I will continue to update as needed but im happy with where it is right now.

More games coming soon, i will eventually make all my scripts into a hub option as well for those who prefer it :)

# Street Outlaws Cash Days (9370296952)

SCRIPT: loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KryptoKee/KeemBandz-Script-Hub/main/street-outlaws.lua"))()

Give and Remove money from yourself

Set Walk Speed / Reset

Donate any amount to other players in your session

Race sniper! Select the Car, Color of car, and Bet then press Join Race when the spots are available to never miss another race.

More updates will come soon for this GUI!!

# Hoop Simulator! Auto Farm (10534865425)

SCRIPT: loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KryptoKee/KeemBandz-Script-Hub/main/hoop-simulator.lua"))()

This script is very simple and only has one function for now.

Stand within range of the hoop for your current level and enable the Auto Farm, you will repeatedly score a basket!

Use slider to adjust time between throws if you get the red messages, i reccomend 3 seconds delay!
